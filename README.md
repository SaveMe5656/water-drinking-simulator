\*drinks water\*

# water drinking simulator
a fairly simple game about staying properly hydrated


## gameplay
keep hydrated by clicking the canvas to drink water. the longer you stay hydrated, the greater the score
- **drink water!** not doing so will dehydrate you and cause you to perish
- **don't drink water!** drinking too much water will drown you and cause you to perish

**advanced:** tweak the game's parameters to match your own skill level, or just cause chaos


## about
I made this game in a little under a day after having inspiration for a while from the name of a channel on a friend's Discord server. had a rough idea of this in my head, then decided to get a character drawn and work off of said inspiration


## variations/ports
- [wdsCE](https://github.com/SaveMe5656/water-drinking-simulator/tree/wdsCE): official port to the TI-84 Plus CE line of calculators
